# Bayesian Statistics â€“ Final Project

This project was conducted as part of the **Bayesian Statistics** course at **ENSAE Paris**, during the 3rd year.

---

## Project Overview

The goal of this project was to apply **Bayesian inference techniques** to a regression setting, with a focus on **Gibbs sampling** for variable selection and posterior estimation.

More precisely, we implemented a **Bayesian variable selection model** and used **Gibbs sampling** to estimate the posterior distribution over the regression coefficients. The initialization step was handled via **Lasso regression**, which guided the prior inclusion probabilities.

## Repository Structure

- `gibbs_sampling.py`  
  Main Python script that implements the **Gibbs sampling algorithm** for Bayesian variable selection. It includes:
  - Prior setup
  - Posterior sampling steps
  - Trace plotting and diagnostics

- `Gibbs brut.ipynb`  
  Jupyter notebook that performs:
  - Data preprocessing and exploration
  - Lasso regression for coefficient sparsity estimation
  - Initialization of the Gibbs sampler
  - Final Bayesian regression and **prediction of the growth rate**

---

## Methods and Tools

- **Bayesian linear regression**
- **Gibbs sampling** for posterior inference
- **Lasso (L1) regularization** for initialization
- Posterior diagnostics and coefficient interpretation
